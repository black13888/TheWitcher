                        <p>In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you'll be faced against all types of enemies, from big monsters
                            such as Fiends, to human bandits, each with their own strengths to look out for and
                            weaknesses to exploit. Specific combat information, such as enemy potions weaknesses, can be
                            found in-game in the Bestiary.</p>
                        <p>Combat in the game starts when you approach a hostile enemy. It may also start if peaceful
                            NPCs witness a slip of a guard (choosing stealing or if you stay in their path), which will
                            not stop until you have defeated all hostiles in the area or you have run far enough away
                            from the area.</p>

                        <p>While on Roach, you are able to jump over obstacles and fight monsters. However, you are only
                            able to swing your sword and shoot your crossbow while on horseback and are unable to use
                            your Bombs and Signs (with the exception of Axii). There are special combat rules while
                            riding Roach - it will usually be a critical hit and there's a chance that the hit will be
                            instant kill the enemy. In addition, being in close proximity to hostiles and getting hit on
                            horseback increases Roach's fear level. Once the fear level reaches the maximum, Roach will
                            stop and throw you to the ground, giving enemies a few free hits on you. Using Axii while on
                            Roach will decrease her fear by a small amount.</p>

                            <p>While Geralt is well-versed in the use of a very wide variety of melee weapons, as a
                                Witcher, his preferred weapons of choice when performing his monster hunting duties are
                                two longswords, one of Steel and one of Silver.</p>
                            <p><span style="color: #e60012;">Steel Sword</span> are effective against humans, some humanoid opponents as well as non-magical
                                beasts such as bears and wolves. Using them against monsters and magical creatures will
                                prove highly ineffective as players may find themselves dealing little to no damage and
                                being subjected to some stunning and staggering moves from these types of opponents when
                                attempting to slash at them with these weapons.</p>
                            <p><span style="color: #e60012;">Silver Sword</span> on the other hand are your bread and butter for cutting through the monster
                                population. These swords are able to slice through most monsters' defenses except for a
                                few types that are immune. Conversely, they are less effective against regular humans,
                                humanoids and non-magical beasts.</p>
                            <p>Players can equip one of each type and swap between them freely in combat. By default,
                                Geralt will automatically draw the appropriate sword based on the opponent upon entering
                                combat. This option can be disabled in the game's Settings. Players can also consult the
                                Bestiary section of the Journal in order to determine the appropriate sword to use to
                                deal with specific opponents types.</p>

                    <div class="weapon_text">
                        <p>Each weapon in The Witcher 3 has several properties that make them more or less effective in
                            combat, as well as non-combat stats that relate to item class, inventory management and
                            other interactions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type - Denotes whether the weapon is a <span style="color: #e60012;">Steel Sword</span>
                                or <span style="color: #e60012;">Silver Sword</span> which determines which slots they
                                can be equipped in. There are also different attack animations depending on the type.
                            </li>
                            <li>Damage - This is the base damage that the weapon can inflict when performing attacks.
                                This will vary based on player level and your damage dealt per swing is shown on the
                                weapon tooltip in inventory. Critical hit chance and critical hit damage calculations
                                are made on top of the base damage.</li>
                            <li>Level - This indicates the minimum level required to equip the weapon. The weapon's
                                level is the primary factor in determining how powerful it is. Higher level weapons tend
                                to deal more damage and may have additional properties and benefits over lower level
                                counterparts.</li>
                            <li>Durability - Weapons lose durability as they are used, which can negatively impact their
                                performance and cause them to become less effective in combat. Weapons can be repaired
                                by visiting Blacksmiths or using repair kits found throughout the game world.</li>
                            <li>Value - This is the amount of gold that a vendor will offer you in exchange for the
                                weapon. This value is indicated by the crown currency symbol.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Main Weapon Properties</h3>
                    <div class="weapon_text">
                        <p>As with most items and equipment in The Witcher 3, Weapons come with varying Rarity — a stat
                            which is denoted by a classification and color coding. In ascending order, the Rarity levels
                            for weapons are as follows:</p>
                        <div class="weapon_box">
                            <div class="weapon_img"></div>
                            <div class="weapon_wz">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1.Common Item</li>
                                    <li style="color: #fff506;">2.Master Item</li>
                                    <li style="color: #109BFF;">3.Magic Item</li>
                                    <li style="color: #FF8C06;">4.Relic</li>
                                    <li style="color: #00FF38;">5.Witcher Gear</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>In general, the rarer a weapon, the better it is but this is not a hard and fast rule. Rarity
                            can influence the amount of Upgrade Slots a weapon has, the number of Bonus Effects it can
                            roll with, as well as the potency of those effects. Note that the same weapon can drop in
                            varying rarity levels, therefore you can have two or more of the same weapon with vastly
                            different stats.</p>
                        <p>Many weapons only exist in the <span style="color: #FF8C06;">Relic</span> tier and are considered unique. <span style="color: #00FF38;">Witcher Gear</span> is less of
                            a rarity level and more of a completely different item classification, but they do tend to
                            outclass most weapons of their level. They also have certain unique properties that push
                            them above all other equipment. See the Witcher Gear section below for details.</p>

                        <h3>Weapon Upgrades</h3>
                        <h4>Runestones</h4>
                        <p>Some weapons can come with up to 3 Upgrade Slots which can be socketed with Runestones. Rarer
                            weapons will tend to have more of these Upgrade Slots available at once.</p>
                        <div class="upgrades_img1"></div>
                        <p>
                            Runestones are special items that grant various bonuses to a weapon, just as <span style="color: #e60012;">Glyphs</span> do for
                            <span style="color: #e60012;">Armor</span>.</p>

                        <div class="upgrades_imgs">
                            <div class="upgrades_img2"></div>
                            <div class="upgrades_img3"></div>
                            <div class="upgrades_img4"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            These bonuses include granting a chance to burn opponents on hit, increase the intensity of
                            Geralt's Signs, increase the rate at which adrenaline is gained and more. Each type of
                            Runestone comes in 3 tiers: Lesser Runestone, Runestone and Greater Runestone, with higher
                            tiers increasing the potency of the bonus granted. See the Runestone page for a full list of
                            Runestones and their effects.</p>
                        <h4>Runewords</h4>
                        <p>
                            With the Hearts of stones DLC, a new type of upgrade is made available in the form of
                            Runewords. These are essentially weapon enchantments imbued onto Swords, granting special
                            effects more substantial than those of Runestones. Only one Runeword can be enchanted onto a
                            weapon and only on those that have 3 Upgrade Slots available. A single Runeword takes up all
                            3 slots, preventing you from adding any more Runestones. However, these Runewords can often
                            change your playstyle drastically or complement your preferred skillset, making them well
                            worth the exchange.</p>

                    <div class="upgrades-item">
                        <h3>Weapon Bonus Effects</h3>
                        <p>Aside from the standard properties and Upgrade Slots available on weapons,they can also roll
                            with varying amounts of Bonus Effects which further boost their effectiveness in different
                            situations.</p>

                            These effects are quite extensive, ranging from boosting raw damage to adding unique perks
                            that change gameplay style, such as boosting Sign intensity or adding extra effects like
                            poisoning enemies. Some effects can be found on both Steel Swords and Silver Swords, while
                            others are unique to a specific weapon type.</p>
                        <p>
                            These effects are quite extensive, ranging from boosting the intensity of a specific Sign,
                            granting a chance to cause elemental damage, to increasing experience gained from defeating
                            monsters. Weapon Rarity will typically influence the Bonus Effects found on weapons, with
                            rarer weapons typically having more effects at once and with greater potency. For Common,
                            <span style="color: #FFF506;">Master</span> and <span style="color: #109BFF;">Magic</span> tier weapons, these effects are typically randomized. <span style="color: #FF8C06;">Relic</span> weapons have a
                            mixture of randomized effects, as well as fixed effects for some of the more unique weapons.
                            All Witcher tier weapons have fixed effects.</p>
                        <p>
                            Another way to boost a weapon's capabilities is to use various Witchers oils. These are
                            substances that can be applied to your blades to grant temporary buffs which typically
                            consist of increased damage against a particular type of enemy. Most Oils are applied onto
                            Silver swords as their effects are usually conducive to counteracting the various Creatures
                            And Monsters Geralt comes across, but there are also some that can be applied to Steel
                            Swords for similar purposes</p>

                                Aard is a simple magical sign used by witchers. It is comprised of a telekinetic thrust that can stun, repel, knock down, or disarm opponents, as well as remove barriers and other objects.</p>

                            <p>
                                Aard is the first sign Geralt 'learns' over the course of the game; one cannot finish the Prologue without it as it is necessary to break through a wall of debris to exit the witchers' laboratory. Its icon is based on the Alchemical symbol for Air. It is the sign that the witcher uses the most. Outside of combat, Aard is most often used to clear a path, either by blowing down a wall or blowing apart a pile of debris. During combat it can stun, knockdown or disarm an opponent.

                                Axii is a simple magical sign comprised of a hypnotic effect and is used by witchers. It can calm down people and creatrues, manipulate their minds or be used to hex enemies, causing them to fight alongside the caster. The effect wears off over time or can be prematurely broken if they take damage from the caster.</p>

                            <p>
                                In the game, the Axii sign can be used to lessen the number of hostile creatures or humanoids Geralt is fighting, a way of evening the odds. The witcher's skill with the sign is developed through the allocation of talents. Note that while hexed creatures will fight alongside the witcher, their kills will not grant experience.

When inscribed on a solid surface, it blocks the monsters from getting closer, scaring them off.If a hostile being enters the area affected by Sign, it is visibly slowed down, and non-corporeal forces become corporeal</p>

Thus it makes sense that its icon appears as an amalgamation of the icons for the rest of the Signs. It is a Sign Geralt makes by drawing a symbol on the ground or the floor. The witcher's skill with the sign is developed through the allocation of talents.

                                Quen is a simple magic sign used by witchers. When cast it forms a protective shield in front of the caster, protecting the witcher from sonic waves and similar attacks from that angle.Its expanded form can protect from the wider range of offensive actions.Contrary to Heliotrop, which is active only for a moment and cushions from a single powerful attack,Quen is active until broken or dispelled.</p>
