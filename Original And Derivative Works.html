                <h3>The Last Wish</h3>
                <p><span>The Last Wish</span> (Polish: Ostatnie życzenie) is the first book in Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series in terms of story chronology, although the original Polish edition was published in 1993, after Sword of Destiny.</p >
                <p>Some of the individual short stories were first published in the Fantastyka magazine or in the Wiedźmin short story collection (the first collection of Sapkowski's stories, out of print and now obsolete; all short stories were later collected in The Last Wish, Sword of Destiny and Something Ends, Something Begins) and as such were the first witcher stories published.</p>
                <p>The first UK edition was released by Gollancz on 7 June 2007 and a second edition was released the next year on 14 February 2008. The US edition was released a few months later, on 1 May 2008 by Orbit.</p>
                <p>Audible UK, in conjunction with Orion Books and Gollancz, released The Last Wish audio on February 27, 2014, only a few short weeks after it was announced. The Last Wish is read by Peter Kenny</p>

                <h3>Sword of Destiny</h3>
                <p><span>Sword of Destiny</span> (Polish: Miecz przeznaczenia) is the second book in Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series in terms of story chronology, although the original Polish edition was published in 1992, before The Last Wish (but after the Wiedźmin short story collection made obsolete by The Last Wish). One of the individual short stories was first published in Fantastyka magazine.</p >
                <p>Both English publishers decided to skip Sword of Destiny and publish Blood of Elves (the first novel in the saga) directly after The Last Wish, even though the short stories in this collection take place earlier and introduce some of the characters that become major characters in the novels.</p>
                <p>The UK edition was subsequently published by Gollancz on 21 May 2015 and the U.S. edition was released by Orbit on 1 December 2015. Gollancz later released a second edition on 10 March 2016.</p>

                <p><span>Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna</span> (English: Something Ends, Something Begins) is a short story collection by Andrzej Sapkowski and the title of one of the stories contained within. Most of the stories are unrelated to The Witcher series, except for "Droga, z której się nie wraca" (featuring Geralt's parents) and "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna", a non-canon humorous story about Geralt and Yennefer's wedding written as a wedding gift for Paulina Braiter and Paweł Ziemkiewicz.</p >

                <h3>The Last Wish</h3>
                <p><span>Season of Storms </span>(Polish: Sezon burz) is the sixth Witcher novel and eighth overall book in the series written by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is not a follow-up to the spin-off of the Witcher series proper, but instead a midquel, set before "The Witcher" short story but after most of the other stories in The Last Wish.
                </p >
                <p>The book was published in English on 22 May 2018 and translated by David French. It's available in hardcover, paperback, and digital format.</p>
