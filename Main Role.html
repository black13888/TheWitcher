                        <p>Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.</p >

                        <p>During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.</p>

                        <p>Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He, therefore, became a true knight.</p>

                            <p>The White Wolf is considered to be one of the most skilled and talented witchers found within the land. He is an excellent sword fighter capable of defeating multiple skilled warriors at once alone through a combination of the use of his swordplay and his witcher magic. Geralt spends nearly every moment he is not working or socializing to train. Every known witcher Sign appears to be at his disposal with the witcher having a great affinity for its use. While not as powerful as a skilled mage he can still manage to protect himself from most spells.</p >

                        <p>Yennefer of Vengerberg, born as Janka on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.</p >

                        <p>She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Council of Wizards within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.

                            <p>At some point, due to her magical potential, she was received in the Aretuza school for sorceresses, where rectoress Tissaia de Vries became her teacher and mother figure. During her training, Yennefer tried to kill herself by cutting both of her wrists, severing her tendons, though she survived. Tissaia claimed that the purposefulness of her attempt was the only thing that prevented her from feeling contempt for her weakness, and continued her training. In accordance with the sorceresses' tradition, any physical flaw, including her hunchback, was magically removed.  Yennefer was a classmate Sabrina Glevissig, though later both feigned friendship with each other, and claimed privately to be the younger of the pair, taking offense at being called each others former classmates. She eventually passed her training and tests in 1186, at the age of 13, and graduated as a sorceress. Three years later, in 1189, she lost her virginity.</p >

                        <p>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253,[4] and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday.[5] She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.</p >

                        <p>After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt invoked the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.</p>

                            <p>Following the death of her mother, Ciri, who is now an orphan, was known to be the last remaining heir to Cintra, and she was given extra care by Calanthe who raised her granddaughter. As Ciri grew up, Calanthe did her best to protect Ciri by preventing her from learning about the truth of being a Child of Surprise and that she was destined to become a witcher since she was born. In spite of Clanthe's efforts, Ciri's nanny told her all about a white-haired witcher, and that one day, he will come for her and she will be taken away to be trained as a witcher. Ultimately, Calanthe found out about this and this made her frantic — but eventually, made peace with it and accepted the fact that it is Ciri's destiny.</p >
                            <p>
                            6 years passed, upon the day when Duny's curse was lifted, Geralt returned to Cintra. Calanthe who learned about Geralt's arrival, ordered to hide Ciri from Geralt among the group of boys, hoping that he wouldn't find her since she did not want to lose her last descendant. Upon Geralt's arrival to the castle, he somehow was fooled and believed that Pavetta had a son and wondered which one was he among the group. This lead to Geralt simply leaving the castle and refused to take any child.

                        <p>Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress in the 13th century. Called the Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A former member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.</p >

                        <p>She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter.Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and was like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.</p>

                        <p>She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never used them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions, and used amulets to treat herself. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.</p>

                            <p>She was born and grew up in Maribor. Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones. This was rather amusing twist of fate as she herself was allergic to magical potions and could only tolerate non magical ones.
                            </p >
                            <p>During her studies, she befriended the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, and by 1249, the two of them were already close friends and colleagues. After graduation, she became a very well known and respected sorceress, taking her assignment as a advisor to the throne of Temeria.</p>
