                <p>Being based on a novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski – a bestselling Polish author – gives the game’s universe and characters credibility, authority and exceptional cohesiveness. In this harsh fantasy world abstract, absolute and unconditional ideas such as “Good” and “Evil” written in upper case letters do not exist. Instead, however, while moral good exists , the protagonist will often only have a choice between two evils, deciding on the path which he regards as the lesser evil of the two.</p >
                <p>The story begins with Geralt reappearing after being feared dead. He is found unconscious, dazed and with only a vague recollection of past events. This way, players unfamiliar with Sapkowski’s works will be able to gradually immerse into the fantasy realm.

            <div class="story-text">
                <p>The game features an innovative, time delayed decision-consequence system, prodding players to make their decisions seriously and with thought.</p >
                <p>The whole world does not revolve just around Geralt. NPCs will lead their lives independently of the protagonist, yet upon interaction they can be influenced by and react to the Witcher’s actions. It’s basically a living world, of which Geralt is only a part of, despite his involvement in its ultimate fate.

                The player is Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, a witcher. Entangled in the political turmoil that engulfed Temeria, Geralt helped quell the rebellion of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Soon after, he saved King Foltest’s life when the monarch was attacked by a witcher-like assassin. He continues to protect the king, serving as his bodyguard as Foltest strives to bring peace to his kingdom. The Order’s last bastions have yielded to the royal army, yet one more task remains - the Baroness La Valette announced her secession from the realm, and her fortress must be taken. A month after the attempted assassination, Foltest’s armies stand at the gates of La Valette Castle, preparing for a final assault. Still at Foltest’s side, Geralt is among them, unable to begin his personal quest to discover the mysterious assassin’s origin and identity

You are unique, different. This puts you in the same precarious position as non-humans who find themselves impaled...
